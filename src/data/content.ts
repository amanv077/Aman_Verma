# What I Learned from Building Vibenox: From Entrepreneur to Product Manager

When I founded Vibenox Private Limited in November 2021, I thought I was just starting an e-commerce business. Little did I know, I was actually getting the most expensive and valuable product management education possible.

## The Market Research Reality Check

I spent months conducting market research, identifying high-demand products in cosmetics and home & lifestyle. I tested product-market fit using small-batch campaigns and learned that assumptions are dangerous without real data.

**Lesson #1: Market research isn't optional - it's survival.** Without understanding what customers actually want, you're just guessing.

## The Supply Chain Nightmare (And How I Survived It)

Managing end-to-end supply chain operations was my first real test. Sourcing, pricing, listing, and fulfillment across platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and custom storefronts taught me about operational complexity.

**Lesson #2: Operations are the backbone of any product business.** Without efficient operations, even the best product ideas fail.

## Digital Marketing: The Data-Driven Revolution

Running campaigns on Meta and Google Ads with continuous A/B testing was where I first fell in love with data. Analyzing daily sales data to identify trends, optimize inventory, and make scaling decisions changed how I think about products forever.

**Lesson #3: Data isn't just numbers - it's your product compass.** Every decision should be informed by data, not gut feeling.

## The Tough Stuff: Navigating Business Challenges

We faced critical business challenges, including partner exits and financial stress. These moments built my resilience and taught me that adaptability isn't optional in business.

**Lesson #4: Resilience is your most valuable business skill.** Every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow stronger.

## From E-commerce to Product Management

Vibenox wasn't just a business - it was my product management bootcamp. I learned to:

- Validate ideas with real customers, not assumptions
- Make data-driven decisions that impact the bottom line
- Balance short-term tactics with long-term strategy
- Navigate uncertainty and adapt to changing circumstances
- Understand the full customer journey from awareness to purchase

## The Product Manager Mindset

Today, as I work on digital KYC systems for Vodacom and lead frontend development, I bring this entrepreneurial mindset to every project. I understand both the business pressures and the technical constraints.

**The best product managers aren't those who've read all the books - they're those who've built, failed, learned, and applied those lessons to help others succeed.**

# From Frontend Lead to Product Thinking: My Vodacom Journey

Joining Reyna Solutions as Frontend Lead for Vodacom's projects in January 2025 was a pivotal moment in my career. Based in Vadodara, I led frontend development for digital KYC and payment systems across South Africa, but the real learning was in bridging the gap between technology and business.

## The Product Proxy Role

From day one, I found myself acting as a product proxy in sprint planning sessions. While my peers focused purely on implementation, I couldn't help but ask: "Why are we building this? How does this impact users? What's the business value?"

**Lesson #1: Great products emerge when engineering and business work in harmony.** Technical excellence alone isn't enough - it needs to serve a business purpose.

## The Cross-Functional Challenge

Collaborating with product, security, and backend teams to integrate SSO, Siebel CRM, and VodaPay wallet was my first real experience with enterprise-level complexity. Each team had different priorities, timelines, and constraints.

**Lesson #2: Communication is the most important technical skill.** Being able to speak both technical and business languages fluently is what makes technical leaders effective.

## The Performance Impact

Our biggest win was reducing the onboarding flow time by 25% through performance improvements and UX refinement. This wasn't just about faster code - it was about understanding how technical decisions directly impact business metrics.

**Lesson #3: User experience improvements drive business results.** Every millisecond and every interaction point matters when you're dealing with customer onboarding at scale.

## Feasibility Analysis and Effort Estimation

Contributing to feasibility analysis and effort estimation in sprint planning taught me to think like a product manager. I learned to balance technical possibilities with business realities and user needs.

**Lesson #4: The best solutions consider technical, business, and user constraints.** Great products happen at the intersection of what's possible, what's profitable, and what users need.

## From Technical Leader to Product Thinker

This role showed me that technical leadership isn't just about writing better code - it's about understanding the bigger picture. It's about asking:

- How does this feature impact user behavior?
- What's the ROI of this technical investment?
- How does this align with our product strategy?
- What's the opportunity cost of choosing this approach?

## The Hybrid Advantage

My journey from entrepreneur to frontend lead to product manager gives me a unique perspective. I understand:

- The business pressures that drive product decisions
- The technical constraints that shape what's possible
- The user needs that should guide everything we build

**In today's world, the most effective product managers are those who can speak both business and technical languages fluently.**

# Why Good PMs Think Like Marketers and Engineers

Product management sits at the intersection of multiple disciplines. The best PMs I know don't just understand business strategy – they think like marketers when defining value propositions and like engineers when considering technical constraints.

## Thinking Like a Marketer

Marketers understand that perception is reality. They know how to:
- Identify and communicate value propositions clearly
- Understand customer segments and personas deeply
- Create compelling narratives around features
- Think about positioning and competitive differentiation

**PM Application:** When defining features, always start with "What's the customer value?" not "What can we build?"

## Thinking Like an Engineer

Engineers understand that implementation details matter. They know how to:
- Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Think about scalability and maintainability
- Make trade-offs between different technical approaches

**PM Application:** When prioritizing features, consider technical debt, implementation complexity, and long-term architectural implications.

# How AI is Changing Product Decision Making

Artificial Intelligence is reshaping every aspect of product management, from how we understand users to how we prioritize features. But some fundamentals remain unchanged.

## What's Changing

### User Research at Scale
AI can now analyze thousands of user interviews, support tickets, and feedback forms to identify patterns that would take humans weeks to find.

### Predictive Analytics
We can now predict user behavior, churn probability, and feature adoption rates with unprecedented accuracy.

### Automated A/B Testing
AI can design, run, and analyze experiments automatically, testing multiple variations simultaneously.

## What's Not Changing

### The Need for Human Judgment
AI can process data and identify patterns, but it can't understand context, empathy, or make ethical decisions.

### The Importance of Strategy
AI can optimize tactics, but product strategy still requires human insight into market dynamics and competitive positioning.
